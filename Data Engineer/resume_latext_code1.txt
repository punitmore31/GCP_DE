\end{itemize}

\section{Experience}

%--- Current Project ---
\cventry{June 2025 -- Present}{Data Engineer 1 (Client: Elisa - Telecom)}{Datametica Birds}{Pune, Maharashtra}{}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Orchestrated Dynamic Airflow Pipelines:} Leveraged dynamic DAGs driven by YAML configurations to automate the migration of legacy Informatica workflows to BigQuery, ensuring scalability and reducing manual coding efforts.
    \item \textbf{Event-Driven Data Ingestion:} Orchestrated event-driven ingestion pipelines by implementing Airflow GCS Sensors to detect file arrival and trigger Dataflow Flex Templates, automating the seamless loading of data into BigQuery.
    % \item \textbf{Fault-Tolerant Pipeline Design:} Implemented robust error handling by configuring \textbf{Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)} within Dataflow pipelines; captured malformed records and schema mismatches in separate BigQuery tables to ensure zero data loss.
    \item \textbf{Resilient ELT Architecture:} Designed an ELT strategy to mitigate Schema Drift from upstream source systems; ingested raw data as loosely typed (String) records into staging layers, followed by strict SQL-based type casting and validation.
    \item \textbf{Legacy Code Conversion:} Translated complex Informatica transformation logic into BigQuery-compatible SQL, ensuring functional parity while optimizing for cloud-native performance.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Optimized cloud expenditure by configuring Dataflow autoscaling parameters and enforcing Newline Delimited JSON (NDJSON) standards for parallel processing.
\end{itemize}}

%--- Previous Project ---
\cventry{Dec 2021 -- May 2025}{Associate Engineer (Client: IBC - Health Insurance)}{Datametica Birds}{Pune, Maharashtra}{}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Cloud Migration:} Spearheaded the migration of Teradata Data Warehouse and DataStage ETL pipelines to Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery), achieving a 30-40\% reduction in infrastructure costs through serverless architecture.
    \item \textbf{Legacy Script Analysis:} Analyzed and converted complex Teradata BTEQ and KSH scripts into BigQuery SQL, ensuring zero data loss and maintaining 100\% logic consistency across production systems.
    \item \textbf{Airflow Optimization:} Developed and optimized Apache Airflow DAGs to orchestrate complex data pipelines, improving system efficiency by 40\% and reducing runtime by 30\% through advanced performance tuning.
    \item \textbf{Data Modeling \& Transformation:} Implemented SCD Type 1 and Type 2 logic in BigQuery to ensure historical data accuracy and enable incremental load capabilities during the transition from legacy systems.
    \item \textbf{Quality Assurance:} Collaborated with testing teams during SIT/UAT phases to validate data accuracy, resolving critical pipeline issues that resulted in a 30\% improvement in post-migration ETL performance.
\end{itemize}}
